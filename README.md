# Forked from `simonsmith/cypress-image-snapshot`

This is a simple fork of [cypress-image-snapshot](https://github.com/simonsmith/cypress-image-snapshot), all it does is add the ability to pass in a `useRelativeSnapshotsDir` option to the `addMatchImageSnapshotPlugin` function which alters the behaviour of the plugin to use a relative path for the snapshots directory instead of an absolute path.
